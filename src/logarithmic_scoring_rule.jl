    create_order(agent::MarketAgent, ::Type{<:AbstractLSR}, model, bidx)

Creates and returns a bid or ask. The function `bid` is called if the agent has no shares. The function `ask`
is called if the agent has no money. If the agent has money and shares, `bid` and `ask` are called with equal probability. 

# Arguments

- `agent::MarketAgent`: an agent participating in the prediction market
- `::Type{<:AbstractLSR}`: a LSR market maker type 
- `model`: an abm object for the prediction market simulation 
- `bidx`: the index of the current order book

end

"""
    transact!(proposal, ::Type{<:AbstractLSR}, model, bidx)

Attempts to find a possible trade for a submitted proposal (bid or ask). Returns `true` if a 
trade was found and performed. Otherwise, `false` is returned. If no trade is performed, the proposal is added to 
the order book.

# Arguments

- `order`: a proposal bid or ask

    in a market allocated to a given event.
